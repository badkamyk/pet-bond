## Description
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13 project. I've used Tanstack Query, React Hook Form, Zod,  Tailwind CSS, EmaiLJS.
The idea was to make an app for animal shelter. You're able to search for available pets. By default, it shows all available options. You can use input to search by breed.
You can also add pets to your favorites and if you need remove them from there.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
